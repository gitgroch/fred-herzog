                    <h2>Early Life</h2>
                    <p>
                        Fred was born Ulrich Herzog in Stuttgart, Germany in 1930 and spent his childhood in Rottweil,
                        Germany. He lost both of his parents
                        during the war, and in 1946 Herzog went to work as an apprentice in his grandparents' hardware
                        store. Disillusioned by the ravages
                        of war and the situation in Germany, he emigrated to Canada in 1952 and settled in Vancouver in
                        1953. During the next several years.
                        Herzog studied photography magazines while working aboard ships for the CPR steamship line, and
                        in
                        1957 he was hired as a medical
                        photographer at St. Paul's Hospital. In 1961, he became the head of the Photo/Cine Division in
                        the
                        Department of Biomedical
                        Communications at UBC, and in 1970 was appointed Associate Director of the Department. Herzog
                        was
                        also hired as an Instructional
                        Specialist in the Fine Arts Department at Simon Fraser University in 1967, and in 1969 became an
                        instructor in the Fine Arts
                        Department at UBC.

                    <h2>Colour Pioneer</h2>
                    <p>
                        Herzog had a walking route through Vancouver that enabled him to build friendships with other
                        photographers and neighbourhood residents
                        and gave him an acute understanding of the daily life and soul of Vancouver. Over the course of
                        several decades, Herzog produced a
                        substantial body of colour photographs, taking urban life, second-hand shops, vacant lots, neon
                        signage and the crowds of people who
                        have populated city streets over the past years as his primary subjects. Herzog's use of colour
                        was
                        unusual in the 1950s and 60s, a
                        time when fine art photography was almost exclusively associated with black and white imagery.
                        Additionally, Herzog photographed using
                        Kodachrome slide film that was notoriously difficult to print. For decades he remained virtually
                        unknown until his mid-seventies when
                        printing technology caught up, allowing him to make archival pigment prints that matched the
                        exceptional colour and intensity of the
                        Kodachrome film.

                    <h2>Recognition</h2>
                    <p> A retrospective exhibition, Fred Herzog: Vancouver Photographs, was held at the Vancouver Art
                        Gallery
                        in 2007 and was the first major
                        recognition of Herzog's body of work. Herzog exhibited his work both in Canada and
                        internationally,
                        including the exhibitions Fred
                        Herzog: Photographs, C/O Berlin, Germany (2010), Fred Herzog: A Retrospective, Equinox Gallery,
                        Vancouver (2012), Eyes Wide Open! 100
                        Years of Leica Photography, Haus der Photographie, Hamburg, Germany (2015), Photography in
                        Canada,
                        1960-2000, National Gallery of
                        Canada, Ottawa (2017), and many others.
                    </p>
                    <p> 
                        In 2010 Herzog received a Honorary Doctorate from Emily Carr
                        University of Art and Design,
                        and in 2014 he received the Audain Prize for Lifetime Achievement in the Visual Arts. An artist
                        profile on Herzog was featured on the
                        Knowledge Network for the series Snapshot: The Art of Photography II in 2011. In 2014, Herzog's
                        photograph Bogner's Grocery (1960)[2]
                        was released as a limited edition stamp as part of Canada Post's Canadian Photography Series.

                    <p>
                        Herzog died on September 9, 2019 at age 88.
